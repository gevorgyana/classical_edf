CLASSICAL EARLIEST DEADLINE FIRST SCHEDULER IMPLEMENTED IN USERSPACE WITH JAVA

- Smart scheduler would select a subset of tasks
- In the examples test suite, show that the scheduler can be used
to implement an abstraction layer over userspace threads, (similar 
to https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly/fibers)
